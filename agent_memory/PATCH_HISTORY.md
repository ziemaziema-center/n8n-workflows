## 2026-05-16 09:00 KST - Controller Bootstrap Memory Pack
- request: Start new TRUE AUTONOMOUS CONTROLLER session with memory-first, validation-first, additive-only, telemetry-aware operating mode.
- files_changed: `AGENTS.md`, `SESSION_BOOT.md`, `agent_memory/KNOWN_FAILURES.md`, `agent_memory/VALIDATED_PATTERNS.md`, `agent_memory/PATCH_HISTORY.md`, `execution_logs/DAILY_EXECUTION_LOG.md`.
- backup_path: Not required because the controller workspace had no existing files.
- validation: PASS. `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File` confirmed 6 files; `Select-String` confirmed markers for memory-first, SESSION_BOOT, known failures, validated patterns, patch history, daily execution log, and immediate implementation target.
- side_effects: Local documentation and memory files only; no EC2, n8n, Docker, GitHub, Telegram, Git repository, or production workflow mutation.
- rollback: Delete the newly added files if rejected.
- next_action: Validate markers, then implement Phase 1 local contracts and dry-run runner scaffold.
