## Pattern: Additive Bootstrap From Empty Workspace
- applies_to: New project directories with no existing local memory or source files.
- procedure: Read source KB from adjacent project memory first, then add local `AGENTS.md`, `SESSION_BOOT.md`, `agent_memory/*`, and `execution_logs/*` without modifying adjacent projects.
- validation: Confirm required files exist and include required markers for SESSION_BOOT, known failures, validated patterns, patch history, and daily execution log.
- rollback: Delete the newly added bootstrap files if the user rejects the bootstrap.
- evidence: Applied on 2026-05-16 KST after the controller workspace was found empty and non-Git.

## Pattern: Phase 1 Before Production Mutation
- applies_to: Telegram -> n8n -> tmux -> Claude/Codex runner integration.
- procedure: Define local contracts and dry-run runner behavior before changing remote EC2/n8n/Docker state.
- validation: Dry-run command wrapper must prove bounded runtime, log capture, exit status capture, summary generation, and kill-switch routing before live workflow activation.
- rollback: Remove local Phase 1 scaffold files or restore from Git checkpoint after repository initialization.
- evidence: Adopted from prior source KB preference for bounded dry runs, local recorder validation, and zero live mutation until readiness review passes.
